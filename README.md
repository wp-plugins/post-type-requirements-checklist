== Description ==

Post Type Requirements Checklist allows admins to require content to be entered before a page/post can be published.  Currently it supports requirements for the following areas on the add/edit screen:
* title
* WYSIWYG editor
* featured image
* excerpt
* categories (allows for minimum required number of categories)
* tags (allows for minimum required number of tags)
* up to 5 custom taxonomies per post type (allows for minimum required number of categories/tags, as detailed above)

PTRC uses OOP standards to add options only for those metaboxes which are supported for each post type and to execute code only on those pages where it is needed.  It works especially well for sites with many custom post types that require content to be entered in a specific way (ie. when a post type requires a specific page template or when the absence of a featured image will break the intended look of a post).  Think of any theme or plugin that supports an image slider powered by a required featured image, and you can surely see where PTRC can come in handy.

To be clear, PTRC does absolutely nothing to the front-end of your site.  It simply forces certain types of data to be added to the add/edit page/post admin screen in order for that content to be published or updated.

PTRC works with multisite networks and allows users to define settings on a per-site basis.
